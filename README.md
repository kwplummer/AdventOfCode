# Advent of Code

This repo contains my Advent of Code solutions, broken up by year.

The 2015 questions are some of the first non-tutorial Lisp code I've written, looking back it's definitely clunkier than what I would write now. The files are more iterative worksheets, with a mix of funtions to solve the problem, and one-off test calls to verify things are working correctly.
